呼吸机，走出实验室
ventilator and goes out of the lab in

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,629
下午或晚上放
the afternoon or in the evening and put

5
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,239
它关闭所以它始终是主要的必需品
it off so it's always the main essential

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,199
我实验室里的东西现在是主要的东西之一
stuff in my lab now one of the main

7
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,600
喷射通风的优点很简单
advantages of jet ventilation is simply

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,600
它为您提供了一个多余的事实
the fact that it offers you one excess

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,298
用于通风和干预
for ventilation and intervention at the

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,759
同一时间，如果你现在比较
same time and if you compare now the

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,918
第二张图片在这里你有很多
second picture here you have a lot of

更多空间更多空间
much more more space more space to

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,978
从声门上观点干预
intervene from a supraglottic view and

14
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,808
对于很多人来说也是如此
this is as well true for a lot of

15
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,140
现在在肺部应用生理学
applications in the lung now physiology

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,628
喷射通风是一个非常复杂的问题
of jet ventilation is a very complex

17
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,747

thing one of the main things what you

18
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:58,658
必须要明白的是，对于喷气式飞机
have to understand is that for a jet

19
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,308

ventilation you always have to have an

20
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,829
开放式通风是主要的通风之一
open ventilation that's one of the main

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,769

00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:16,179
意识到有些患者有
aware that some of the patients have a

26
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,909
胸壁顺应性问题如此
problem with thoracic wall compliance so

27
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:21,578
只有极少数患者
there are only a very few patients which

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,019
是你不能应用喷气机的地方
is where you cannot apply jet

29
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:25,118
通风不到一个
ventilation that's less than one

30
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,448
我认识的所有患者的百分比
percentage of all the patients I knew

31
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,237
现在，如果你寻找让我们说的更老
now if you look for let's say the older

32
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,368
你只有聊天通风的形式
forms of chat ventilation you only have

33
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,950
一个频率和关于
one frequency and in regards to

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,319
您可以选择生理学
physiology you either can choose with a

35
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,808
低频或高频带
low frequency or a high frequency with a

36
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,299
低频意味着你可以诱导
low frequency that means you can induce

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,578
潮气通风较高
tidal ventilation with a higher

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,159
例如，你可以增加频率
frequency you can increase for example

39
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:54,250
使用你的窥视，这意味着氧气，但
use your peep that means oxygenation but

40
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,039
如果你结合其中两种方法，如果
if you combine two of these means so if

41
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,618

frequency jet and a higher frequency jet

43
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,659
同时你可以叠加这些
at the same time you can overlay these

44
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,819
两种生理学，为您提供
two physiologies and that offers you

45
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,087
控制po2和po2时有很大的优势

46
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,669
pco2同样如此
pco2 at the same

47
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,399
时间，如果你申请这个你还有一个
time if you apply this you still have a

双级
bi-level

49
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,419
通风，但你有两个层面
ventilation but on both levels you have

50
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,490
仍在振荡，由此而来
still oscillation and by this

51
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:28,310
振荡你可以减少pco2
oscillation you can reduce pco2 by less

52
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:31,139
高原压力这是一个伟大的
plateau pressures this is a great

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,867
与传统相比的优势

如果你看，发表得很好
is well very well published if you look

56
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,360
进入较老的文献 - 来自
into the literature that's older - from

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,530
2012年显示，如果你比较

正常喷射通风换气
ventilation with normal jet ventilation

60
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,679
然后你可以看到氧合作用
then you can see that the oxygenation is

61
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:55,199
更好，以及pco2清除
better as well as the pco2 clearance is

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,508
更好，这是pco2清除
better so that is the pco2 clearance

63
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,788
这是氧合作用，它会好得多
that's the oxygenation it's much better

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,699
为此，这种方法就是你
for this for this approach is that you

156
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,639
完全控制报警权和
have perfect control of alarm right and

157
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:22,829
这就是我们可以避免的事情
that's what we can avert let's will be

158
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:24,240
用他们的鼻喷射器实现
achieved with a their nasal jet

159
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,290
通风我们这样做是为了分析
ventilation we do that for analysis of

160
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,339
心包积液你可以看我怎么样
pericardial effusion you can see how I

161
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,670
缩回检索心包
retract retrieve that pericardial

162
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:42,449
积液现在再次很容易应用
effusion now again very easy application

163
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:46,199
这是在我们听到的热成形术期间
this is during thermoplasty as we heard

164
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,589
再来一次，你必须有一个非常
before again you have to have a very

165
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,529
良好的肺部控制，这是
good control of the lung and this is the

166
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,199
定期安装喷气式呼吸机
regular set up the the jet ventilator

167
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,910
你没有在月球上看到它，但你可以
you don't see it at the moon but you can

168
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,230
也许你会听到它
maybe you hear it in the in the

169
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,800
再次背景这是一个过激行为
background again it's a the excesses

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,050
再次鼻腔喷射通气所以
again the nasal jet ventilation so

171
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,009
没什么特别的
nothing special

172
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,139
但绝对控制肺部
but absolutely control about the lung

173
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:13,920
再次是微波炉的问题
again is the issue during microwave

174
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,649
我们使用的消融转移辅助方法
ablation transfer assic approach we use

175
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,559
在这里，我们测量时间
it like this here we measured the times

176
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,170
开/关表，例如当你
on/off table for example when you

177
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,490
比较这种插管方法
compare this approach to intubation

178
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,588
麻醉学它更快更快
anesthesiology it is much faster and

179
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:30,899
它更容易我们只需要10分钟
it's easier we only need 10 minutes of

180
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,389
从表中拿出阿尔法纸
taking on alpha paper out of the table

181
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:36,000
如果你去放松的话
and if you go for relaxation as it is

182
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,178
完成麻醉学你需要花费很多
done with anesthesiology you take much

183
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:42,778
更长的时间，所以快速快速容易
longer time so very quick fast easy

184
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,500
我们控制微波消融
we control during microwave ablation

185
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,969
例如出血也是如此
bleeding for example as well with that

186
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:51,389
仪器让放射科医生喜欢
instrument so the radiologists love the

187
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,758
接近你有完美的控制权
approach you have perfect control of

188
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:55,668
肺部运动，你可以在这里看到它
lung movement as you can see it here

189
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,379
完美的控制，你真的可以告诉
perfect control you really can tell the

190
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,508
什么都没有介入放射科医生
interventional radiologists when nothing

191
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,490
正在发生的事情，你仍然
is happening in the line and you still

192
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,028
现在已经控制了血气
have control of the blood gases now as

193
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,697
一件事是我们可以使用它
well one thing is that we can use that

194
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,928
聊天帽作为僵硬站立的意思
chat cap as a mean for rigid standing

195
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,109
虽然这意味着我们已经应用了这个J.
though that means we've applied this J

196
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:19,109
站在脓毒性布兰卡瘘我们
standing in a septic Branca fistula we

197
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,538
在鼻腔上应用注册和部署
applied register and deployment on nasal

198
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,168
喷射咳嗽
jet cough

199
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,418
所以这意味着我们开始穿夹克
so it means we started with a jacket for

200
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,250
在那个脓毒症患者和
ventilation in that septic patient and

201
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,548
然后我们应用了cha-cha刚性
then we applied over the cha-cha rigid

202
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,479
正确地部署支架以便提供
to deploy the stand right so that gives

203
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:35,908
当你开始时，你会更安全
you more security when you start that

204
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,668
过程，例如非常关键
process and for example very critical

205
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,928
患者这是另一个例子
patients this is another example where

206
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:46,649
我们申请不同的工作
we apply with different working

207
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,149
气管中的参数是一个
parameters in the trachea so that was a

208
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,668
每个鼻腔和管腔脓肿
per nasal and the luminal abscess

209
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,808
排水那是你的小腿小腿
drainage that's a7f pigtail calf you had

210
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,508
进入那个需要保守的警告
to get into that caveat you have to keep

211
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:03,719
以捷豹为例打开它
it open by that Jaguar for example

212
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,089
有通风夹克
there's the jacket for ventilation on

213
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:06,928
另一边
the other side

214
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,447
这就是我销售Viktor的原因
and that's me the selling of Viktor this

215
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,750
这样做是灵活的，不是僵硬的
is done flexible not rigid right so

216
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,769
再次便宜快速轻松快速擅长
again cheaper fast easy quick excels

217
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,859
而且总有一点是要记住这一点
and always one point is to remember that

218
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:23,658
你有情况，你有
you have situations where you have the

219
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,188
应用所谓的数字化
to apply the so-called digital

220
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,109
例如，通风
ventilation that is for example

221
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:29,808
有时错综复杂的岩石撕裂或
sometimes intricate rocky lacerations or

222
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:32,089
你必须去的跟踪手术
tracker surgery where you have to go

223
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:34,519
超出你的问题通风和
beyond your problem to ventilate and

224
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,308
再次，这很容易做到
again this is very easy to be done by

225
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,589
由喷气式直升机喷射的喷气式飞机
the jet by the jet copter that was a

226
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:42,379
我们已经注意到的情况和
case where we've fixated and and the

227
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,408
卡车将穿过小鸟针
truck will stand through a birdie needle

228
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,719
在那里，我和Versa一起长大
there you I grew up with the Versa

229
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:51,288
针头，他们有一个抓取器
needle that they have a grabber to get

230
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,479
但要获得那条线，如果我有
that but to get that line and if I had

231
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:58,879
从上面通风，你知道我们
ventilated from above you know then we

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,370
你下面有很多动静
had a lot of movement from below you

233
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,528
知道我们抓住它会容易得多
know it's much easier for us to to grab

234
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,109
那东西这是茶壶的情况
that thing this is a tea pot case so

235
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:12,288
通过导航和你的相关频道
related channel by a navigation and you

236
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,528
我可以再次看到没有肺部运动
can see again no lung movement all I

237
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,490
有绝对时间旋转我的ENB
have absolutely time to rotate my ENB

238
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,308
限制进入那个模块
cap right to get into that module that

239
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:24,828
大约18毫米90毫米
was around 18 millimeters 90 millimeters

240
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:28,099
并且是一种类癌，这也是
and was a carcinoid and again this is

241
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:31,548
绝对是完整和必要的
absolutely a necessity of complete and

242
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,038
完美的学习控制权我们使用它
perfect learn control right we use it

243
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,240
有时候收费也是如此
sometimes as well in charges so for lvr

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,750
例如，我们试图证明是否负载
for example we try to prove if the load

245
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,870
间接通风或密集
is dense by indirect ventilation or

246
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,719
直接通风的叶片本身
direct ventilation of the lobe itself so

247
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,428
我们可以用喷射器证明
we can prove with a with a jet

248
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,818
间接通风如果是
ventilation in an indirect mean if the

249
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:01,519
现在我想要的是耳垂非常密集
lobe is really dense now I just want to

250
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,649
向您展示我的锥形束CT实验室的一个案例
show you one case of my cone beam CT lab

251
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,889
那是一位667岁的女士
that was a lady 667 years old she had

252
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,250
这些结节三年就是这样
these nodules for three years so that is

253
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,408
结节大约11毫米和一个
a nodule about 11 millimeters and one

254
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,538
80毫米的模型都是
model of 80 millimeters it was both

255
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,578
支气管和阳性和血管我
bronchus and positive and vessels I'm

256
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,879
积极的现在似乎不是那样
positive now seems to be not that

257
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,370
很复杂，但你可以看到会发生什么
complicated but you can see what will

258
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,099
现在发生的是清晰度社区
happen now that's the clarity community

259
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:26,958
我使用清晰度我从一开始就知道
I use clarity I've been known since one

260
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:29,058
半年，所以我们改变了
and a half years so we changed from

261
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:29,769
西门子到
Siemens to

262
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,168
重力是由于一些经济原因
gravity that was due to some economical

263
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,548
这台机器的一个优点是
things one advantage of that machine is

264
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,677
你可以应用整体的一切
that you can apply everything the whole

265
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,958
现在你没有实验室规划
planning in the lab now you don't have

266
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:43,927
去外面是啊有一些
to go outside yeah there are some

267
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,998
缺点例如你不能
disadvantages for example you cannot

268
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,577
菲利普斯从头上引导帽子
steer the Hat by Phillips from the head

269
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,769
本身你有西门子的一些旋钮
itself you have some knobs with Siemens

270
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,278
你现在可以这么做了
you can do that now we used these days

271
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,307
我们e / m和机器所以美敦力
we the e/m and machine so the Medtronic

272
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,769
系统现在我们也改为支气管
system now we change to bronchus as well

273
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,958
我们有vbn和commune的组合
we have a combination of vbn and commune

274
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:04,807
现在的城市，但我们设法得到
city now but however we managed to get

275
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:09,488
那里和我们看到的是我们已经让我们
there and what we saw is we had let's

276
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:11,258
说预先计划的相当好的叠加
say quite good overlay of a pre-planned

277
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,677
扁平的路径，然后我们试着看到它
flat path and then we try to see it with

278
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,589
我们的MB与我们的宜必思酒店在一起
our MB with our Ibis and it was around

279
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,859
12点钟我们不满意
12 o'clock we were not satisfied with

280
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:23,229
我们已经完成了另一个km城市和我们
that we've done another km city and we

281
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,238
可以看到结节分开了
could see that the nodules separated

282
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,479
在这里操纵你可以看到
during the manipulation here you can see

283
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:32,618
那不只是分开你再次做到了
that not just separated you did it again

284
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:38,207
设法进入该模块和
managed to get into into that module and

285
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:41,557
再次在这里你可以看到2d的叠加
again here you can see the overlay of 2d

286
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,248
和3D以及MV活动当然
and 3d and the MV activity and of course

287
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:48,339
他看到了它总是依赖的运动
he see the movement it always depends on

288
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,827
控制肺过度充气
the control of the lung hyperinflation

289
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,708
再这就是你控制的东西了
so again that's what you control with a

290
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,807
根据杰克呼吸机
Jack ventilator according to the

291
00:13:56,009 --> 00:14:00,128
珍贵的，这是肺部肿瘤
precious and this was emitted lung tumor

292
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:03,927
所以第一个房客不是恶性的
so the first lodger was not malignant

293
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,479
现在这个案子很有意思
now the interesting thing in that case

294
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:10,508
当我们试图弄清楚这是什么时
was as we tried to figure out what this

295
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:12,788
模块又是一个超过三个的金莺
module was again an Oriole over three

296
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,028
我们在EN看到的岁月，我们总能做到
years we saw in EN and we always could

297
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,028
达到那部分而不是那部分，所以我们
reach that part not that part so we

298
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,947
再次分割该模块，我们只
segmented again that module and we only

299
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:23,618
我想进入那个区域就是为什么
wanted to get into that area that's why

300
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:25,868
我们再做一次转移资产所以a
we did it again transfer asset so a

301
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:30,038
植物3d转移资产方法和
plant 3d transfer asset approach and

302
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,288
这是脂质ik腺癌
this was a lipid ik adenocarcinoma be

303
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,378
旁边是一个omlette肺肿瘤所以我们是
beside an omlette lung tumor so we were

304
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,899
很有趣的情况，这一切都是
quite interesting case and all this is

305
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,437
完成了社区和喷射通风
done and a community and jet ventilation
