1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,609
现在我专注于喷射通气研究从那以后十多年一直坚持喷射通气研究。
Now jet ventilation i'm belonging to I'm staying on jet ventilation then since more than a decade.

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:19,658
它在我实验室是绝对必需品。我的护士长每天早上打开喷射通气装置，下午或者晚上离开时关闭它。
It's the absolutely necessity in my lab and my main nurse starts every morning to put on the jet ventilator and goes out of the lab in the afternoon or in the evening and put it off.

3
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,239
所以它始终是我实验室里的主要必需品。
So it's always the main essential stuff in my lab.

4
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,600
喷射通气的优点很简单。
Now one of the main advantages of jet ventilation is simply.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,500
它在同一时间为您提供了通气和介入治疗。
The fact that it offers you one access for ventilation and intervention at the same time.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:46,759
如果你现在比较两张图片，你可以从第二张图片看到声门上的介入提供了更多更多的空间，在肺部运用中也是如此。
And if you compare now the second picture here you have a lot of much more more space, more space to intervene from a supraglottic view and this is as well true for a lot of applications in the lung.

7
00:00:47,009 --> 00:01:00,140
喷射通气是一个非常复杂的问题，你必须要明白的是，对于喷射通气必须开放式通气。
Now physiology of jet ventilation is a very complex thing one of the main things what you have to understand is that for a jet ventilation you always have to have an open ventilation.

8
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:02,829
这是最主要的之一。
That's one of the main things.

9
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,578
第二件事是你始终拥有探索灵感。
The second one is that you have to have always inspiration exploration at the same time.

10
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:19,108
第三件事是你必须意识到有些患者有胸壁顺应性问题。
And one of the the third things is that you have to be aware that some of the patients have a problem with thoracic wall compliance.

11
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:30,578
只有极少数患者不能运用喷射通气，这类患者在我认识的所有患者中占比不足百分之一。
So there are only a very few patients which is where you cannot apply jet ventilation that's less than one percentage of all the patients I knew.

12
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,237
现在，让我们说说老式的 喷射通气。只有一种频率的通气，你可以选择低频或者高频。
Now if you look for let's say the older forms of jet ventilation you only have one frequency and in regards to physiology you either can choose with a low frequency or a high frequency.

13
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,808
低频意味着你可以诱导潮气量。随着频率的提高，你可以增加，患者呼气末正压，这意味着氧合。
With a low frequency that means you can induce tidal ventilation. With a higher frequency you can increase for example your  PEEP that means oxygenation.

14
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:54,250
但是如果你把这两种方法结合起来，那么如果你有一台机器同时提供一个正常频率的喷射和一个更高频率的喷射，你可以叠加这两种生理学效应。
But if you combine two of these means so if you have a machine offering you a normal frequency jet and a higher frequency jet at the same time you can overlay these two physiologies.

15
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,819
当你同时控制PO2和PCO2时，这给你带来了巨大的优势。
And that offers you great advantages as you control PO2 and PCO2 at the same time.

16
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:28,478
时间，如果你申请这个你还有一个
If you apply this you still have a bi-level ventilation but on both levels you have still oscillation and by this oscillation you can reduce PCO2 by less plateau pressures.

17
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:40,758
高原压力这是一个伟大的
This is a great advantage in comparison to conventional tidal ventilation like by power and this is well very well published if you look into the literature.

18
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:55,370
进入较老的文献 - 来自
That's older - from 2012 showing that if you compare superimpose higher frequency jet ventilation with normal jet ventilation, then you can see that the oxygenation is better as well as the PCO2 clearance is better.

19
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,679
更好，这是PCO2清除
So that is the PCO2 clearance.

20
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,788
这是氧合作用，它会好得多。
That's the oxygenation. It's much better than normal frequency jet ventilation。

21
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:14,627
现在Carl Reiner介绍了双胞胎
Now Carl Reiner has introduced the TwinStream. And Carl Reiner as a company from Austria has designed a lot of instruments optimal for the double frequency jet ventilation.

22
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:23,719
频率喷射通气这是其中之一
This is one of the examples you can get it for ENT problem but as well for for rigid bronchoscopy in the normal pulmonary area.

23
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:32,329
这是双胞胎的监视器
This is the monitor of the TwinStream. you can apply as well each relations as well for the high frequency as well for the low frequency.

24
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:45,889
以及当然的低频率
Of course you can apply the working pressure which is in easy settings only relay related or linked to the body weight.

25
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:55,250
体重越复杂
For the more complex procedures or views you can you can setup it manually.

26
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:04,550
像激光功能这样的功能
You have variable functions like laser function here for example you have complete real-time measurement of all the pressure which induce so.

27
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:22,400
诱导这样，我相信这很容易
And I believe it's a very easy and safe mean it's a very good machine and I mean very well known applications thoracic surgery and ICU in ent but as well an intervention pulmonology.

28
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:32,720
我亲自使用它或多或少700
Personally I'm using it more or less 700 to 800 times per year at the moment international pulmonology as well interventional cardiology I will show you that later on some examples.

29
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:46,909
你以后的一些例子现在有些
Now some people believe that jet ventilation is still a dangerous thing that is definitely not true you have a real-time pressure monitoring so you don't have to fear borrow trauma as long as you keep that access open.

30
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:58,340
那个访问开放你有一个
You have a humidification system you can control separately by superposed on frequency jet ventilation PO2 and PCO2 by the two different frequencies.

31
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:09,679
如果你想要不同的频率
If you want to apply it in an easy and quick way you only look for weight based parameters and of course there are a lot of instruments certified for that TwinStream.

32
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:25,008
流我们现在在2008年发表于此
Now we published in 2008 in this more or less registry we analyzed in hundred patient 3,300 parameters and this is a typical application as we use it in non rigid approaches.

33
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:35,780
接近，所以我们使用那个喷射帽
So we use that jet catheter that's a double lumen catheter in which we can do more or less everything which we can do as well over rigid bronochscopy.

34
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,638
喷气式飞机凯西有急诊室，我有另一个
Beside that jet catheter and I have another flexible solution that's a jet tube.

35
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:49,460
这是我们喜爱的特别设计的电子管
That's a specially designed tube we love this approach very much because it gives us as well stability in the fairings for the tongue for example.
 
36
00:05:49,490 --> 00:06:05,030
例如，舌头就是这样
And it's very easy to put it.In Germany, I have to pay the anesthesiologist. So one hour of anesthesiology costs me 250 to 300 euro and that saves me around 200 euro per case.

37
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:15,559
现在，如果你进入指标和
Now if you go into the metrics and of literature you can see that in the last three years you have a four-fold increase about nasal jet ventilation.

38
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:23,539
增加鼻腔喷射通气所以
So it's an upcoming method and I just want to show you some of the examples what we do in my lab.

39
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:31,669
在我的实验室做，所以这是一个很抱歉
So this is a so sorry for that the audio is not working at the moment oh you can hear you can hear it.

40
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:38,900
是的，所以你听到了喷气式呼吸机
Yeah so that you hear the jet ventilator in the background and you see there's no lung movement although we go transfer to navigate small approach.

41
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:49,299
酸用于导航小方法所以
So that is more or less interventional radiology this is done under cone CT at the moment from Philips clarity.

42
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:57,619
这是IBA的一次破坏所以它是一个
This is a puncture of EBUS so it's a pericardial access pericardial access by EBUS we published this in 2016.

43
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:04,249
我们在2016年发布的IBAs是
We are doing that regularly you can see it here.

44
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:10,369
你在这里再次拒绝你
You all you again hear the jet ventilator in the background you see the needle in the pericardium.

45
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,950
你看到跳动的心脏，没有
You see beating heart and nothing happens we absolutely essential thing for this.

46
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,809
为此，这种方法就是你
For this approach is that you have perfect control of lung. Right? 

47
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:28,460
这就是我们可以避免的事情
That's will be achieved with a nasal jet ventilation. We do that for analysis of pericardial effusion.

48
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:42,619
心包积液你可以看我怎么样
You can see how I retract that pericardial effusion now again very easy application.

49
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:49,760
这是在我们听到的热成形术期间
This is during thermoplasty as we heard before again you have to have a very good control of the lung.

50
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,369
良好的肺部控制，这是
And this is the regular set up the jet ventilator.

51
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,400
你没有在月球上看到它，但你可以
You don't see it at the moment but you can maybe you hear it in the background again.

52
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:05,179
再次背景这是一个过激行为
It's the access again the nasal jet ventilation so nothing special.

53
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,309
但绝对控制肺部
But absolutely control about the lung.

54
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:16,820
再次是微波炉的问题
Again is the issue. During microwave ablation approach we use it like this.

55
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:25,659
在这里，我们测量时间
Here, we measured the times on/off table for example when you compare this approach to intubation anesthesiology.

56
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:33,559
麻醉学它更快更快
It is much faster and it's easier we only need 10 minutes of taking on the table.

57
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:39,349
如果你去放松的话
And if you go for relaxation as it is done with anesthesiology you take much longer time.

58
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:48,139
更长的时间，所以快速快速容易
So very quick fast easy we control during microwave ablation. Bleeding for example as well with that instrument.

59
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:55,840
仪器让放射科医生喜欢
So the radiologists love the approach you have perfect control of lung movement as you can see it here.

60
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:02,660
完美的控制，你真的可以告诉
Perfect control. You really can tell the interventional radiologists when nothing is happening in the lung and you still have control of the blood gases.

61
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:13,099
现在已经控制了血气
Now as well one thing is that we can use that jet catheter as a mean for rigid stenting.

62
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:22,340
虽然这意味着我们已经应用了这个J.
Though that means we've applied this J stenting in a septic bronoch fistula we applied rigid stent and deployment on nasal jet catheter.

63
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:33,649
所以这意味着我们开始穿夹克
So it means we started with a jet catheter for ventilation in that septic patient and then we applied over the jet catheter rigid to deploy the stent right so that gives you more security.

64
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:46,820
当你开始时，你会更安全
When you start that process and for example very critical patients this is another example where we apply with different working parameters in the trachea.

65
00:09:46,850 --> 00:10:00,677
气管中的参数是一个
So that was a per nasal and the luminal abscess drainage that's a 7F pigtail catheter you had to get into that caveat you have to keep it open by that Jet wire.

66
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:07,099
以捷豹为例打开它
For example, there's the jet for ventilation on the other side.

67
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,619
这就是我销售Viktor的原因
And that's the 7F pigtail.

68
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:17,940
这样做是灵活的，不是僵硬的
This is done flexible not rigid right so again cheaper fast easy quick access.

69
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:34,690
而且总有一点是要记住这一点
And always one point is to remember that you have situations where you have the to apply the so-called distal ventilation that is for example sometimes in trachea lacerations or trachea surgery where you have to go beyond your problem to ventilate.

70
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:51,460
再次，这很容易做到
Again this is very easy to be done by the jet catheter that was a case where we've fixated and the trachea stent through a birdie needle there you  have a grabber to get that.

71
00:10:51,490 --> 00:11:03,700
但要获得那条线，如果我有
But to get that line and if I had ventilated from above you know then we had a lot of movement from below you know it's much easier for us to grab that thing.

72
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:24,999
那东西这是茶壶的情况
This is a key case so related channel by a navigation and you can see again no lung movement all I have absolutely time to rotate my ENB catheter right to get into that nodule that was around 18 millimeters 90 millimeters.

73
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:41,410
并且是一种类癌，这也是
And was a carcinoid and again this is absolutely a necessity of complete and perfect lung control right we use it sometimes as well in charges so for lvr.

74
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:52,599
例如，我们试图证明是否负载
For example we try to prove if the load is dense by indirect ventilation or direct ventilation of the lobe itself so we can prove with a jet ventilation in an indirect mean.

75
00:11:52,629 --> 00:12:03,820
间接通风如果是
If the lobe is really dense now I just want to show you one case of my cone beam CT lab.

76
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:12,580
那是一位667岁的女士
That was a lady 67 years old she had these nodules for three years so that is a nodule about 11 millimeters and one nodule of 80 millimeters.

77
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:20,050
80毫米的模型都是
It was both bronchus and positive and vessels I'm positive now seems to be not that complicated.

78
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,540
很复杂，但你可以看到会发生什么
But you can see what will happen.

79
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,269
现在发生的是清晰度社区
Now that's the clarity cone beam CT.

80
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:32,340
我使用清晰度我从一开始就知道
I use clarity I've been known since one and a half years so we changed from Siemens to clarity that was due to some economical things.

81
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:38,849
这台机器的一个优点是
One advantage of that machine is that you can apply everything.

82
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,129
现在你没有实验室规划
The whole planning in the lab now you don't have to go outside.

83
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:48,748
去外面是啊有一些
Yeah there are some disadvantages for example you cannot steer the head by Phillips from the head itself.

84
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,940
本身你有西门子的一些旋钮
You have some knobs with Siemens you can do that.

85
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,450
你现在可以这么做了
Now we used these days.

86
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,129
我们e / m和机器所以美敦力
The machines so the Medtronic system now we change to bronochscopy as well we have a combination of VBN and cone beam CT now.

87
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:11,427
现在的城市，但我们设法得到
But however we managed to get there and what we saw is we had let's say quite good overlay of a pre-planned flat path

88
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:21,028
扁平的路径，然后我们试着看到它
And then we try to see it with our EBUS and it was around 12 o'clock we were not satisfied with that.

89
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:25,408
我们已经完成了另一个km城市和我们
We've done another cone beam CT and we could see that the nodules separated during the manipulation.

90
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,649
在这里操纵你可以看到
Here you can see that not just separated.

91
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:41,729
那不只是分开你再次做到了
You did it again managed to get into into that nodule and again here you can see the overlay of 2D and 3D and the clarity.

92
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:50,998
和3D以及MV活动当然
And of course he see the movement it always depends on the control of the lung hyperinflation.

93
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,879
再这就是你控制的东西了
So again that's what you control with a jet ventilator.

94
00:13:53,908 --> 00:14:00,298
根据杰克呼吸机
According to the pressure and this was emitted lung tumor.

95
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:04,099
所以第一个房客不是恶性的
So the first nodule was not malignant.

96
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:10,677
现在这个案子很有意思
Now the interesting thing in that case was as we tried to figure out what this nodule was.

97
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:21,119
模块又是一个超过三个的金莺
Again an nodule over three years we saw in EMN and we always could reach that part not that part so we segmented again that nodule and we only wanted to get into that area.

98
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:32,460
我想进入那个区域就是为什么
That's why we did it again transfer asset so a plant 3D transfer asset approach and this was a lipid adenocarcinoma beside an omlette lung tumor.

99
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:41,609
旁边是一个omlette肺肿瘤所以我们是
So we were quite interesting case and all this is done and a cone beam CT and jet ventilation.

100
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:52,899
现在来看看Ender's for nasal
Now to come to the End. For me jet ventilation especially nasal jet ventilation is an absolutely necessity and intervention pulmonology.

101
00:14:52,928 --> 00:15:04,149
我们正在做大约70起案件
And we're doing about 70 cases in on regular lab approaches with jet ventilation you do not have to fear any barotrauma

102
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:07,479
barotrauma你我们有一个非常安全的二氧化碳
You we have a very safe CO2 elimination.

103
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:19,269
在那篇论文中我们消除了
In that one paper we published we couldn't find any risk sign in regards to age in regards to body weight in regards to heart and sufficiency for example it's all very well published.

104
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:28,210
很好地发表所以唯一的事情是
So the only thing was that after an average time of 42 minutes we saw a little increase of PCO2 on average.

105
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:39,190
平均但我们已经不再知道了
But we have none of these patients had to be ventilated by normal tube ventilation and we've done interventions up to four and a half hours only by nasal jet ventilation.

106
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,649
小时只能通过鼻腔喷射通气
So in Germany it saves us a lot of money.

107
00:15:44,678 --> 00:16:00,879
她的情况现在大约200欧元，不知何故
Her case around 200 euro now Chong Bai you know that video that was one of the first cone beam CT is I think in Shanghai when we've done that as well with the TwinStream.

108
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:04,809
我喜欢这段视频
I love that video.

109
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:20,460
我总是表现出来因为
Still I always show it because it's a very nice day we've done three cases during that day with live intervention.

110
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:35,028
我现在在这里进行ology和生命干预
Now here I'm putting the jet catheter you're applying the TwinStream then you have perfect control of the lung.

111
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:40,849
完美掌控你所做的路线
You do the dynamic CT of the cone beam CT.

112
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,460
随你
Then you have the segmentation of that nodule. 

113
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,889
的奶酪，然后你
It was not that small.


114
00:16:51,918 --> 00:17:02,139
你不知道它不是那么小
However you know for these days it was the first time in 2015.

115
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:09,499
在2015年，然后你分段路径
And then you segment the path in these cases.

116
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:31,788
这些情况我们碰巧做了
We have to do a t-box so we had a bronoch sound.

117
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:46,578
在这件事中，这是第一个
These were the first discussions about the training center which you now have in Shanghai about the cone beam CT center.

118
00:17:46,608 --> 00:18:16,650
所以这是一个非常复杂的领域
So that's a very sophisticated area to learn all these technologies just let it through. It's too much and it's so the people understand how cone beam CT works.

119
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:27,460
现在你有了所见的3D模型
Now you have the 3D models as you see on the fluoro you don't see really that kind of of lesion and you do a three-edged angulations.

120
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:40,470
你做了一个三角形的角度我们
We see how the 3D and 2D overlays that's quite a good overlay we are centered here.

121
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,650
我们对活检有很高的特异性
We have a high specificity of biopsy because we have controlled it with our EBUS as well.

122
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:51,190
伊娃也是，这是一个模具
And that was a MALT associated lymphoma.

123
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,578
很难得到这么多
So quite difficult to get.

124
00:18:55,608 --> 00:19:02,870
谢谢你的邀请
So many thanks for the invitation

125
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:37,200
谢谢你谢谢你的精彩
Thank you. Thank you for your wonderful speech and I know TwinStream is very good.

126
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:44,729
认为它的原因非常好
Because in China we use high frequency ventilation for many years.

127
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:52,410
你在中国认识的中国党
But in China you know high frequency ventilator just have only one level pressure. But TwinStream has bi-level pressure.

128
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,308
堆积所以我们不能把pso2等同起来
So we can increase the PO2.

129
00:19:56,338 --> 00:20:00,420
我说过我们是最重要的
What is the most important for the high frequency.

130
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:18,328
后来的传统，但你好
TwinStream has a license in rigid bronchoscopy.

136
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:21,870
包含有关ARP分配的本质
But they still not got the license in ARDS.

137
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,818
我的意思是她非常有趣
I am very interesting about the use of TwinStream in ARDS.

138
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:36,210
我们的情况当然我们使用我没有
Of course we use I haven't shown that you know of course we use the TwinStream as well and rigid bronchoscopy.

139
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,940
正如我解释的那样，再次在德国复制
But in Germany again as I explained before when I want to use rigid bronchoscopy I have to invite my anesthesiologist to come to my lab.

140
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:54,120
麻醉师来我的实验室
And we have to pay them right so that increases the costs in my department.

141
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,068
我们尝试应用干预肺病学
Whenever we can do things in intervention pulmonology we try to apply the nasal jabbed ventilation the Jack calf as I shown.

142
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:08,940
我展示的小牛或灵活的小牛
Or the the flexible. There's a special flexible tube which you can ply as well as a flexible bronchoscopy.

143
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:21,870
然而，这节省了我的成本和
However that saves me costs and the paper which I have shown with a hundred cases and 3300 was only done with flexible applications not rigid applications and we haven't seen any danger sign.

144
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:33,420
危险的标志，所以没有问题
So there was no problem at all for PO2 and as well not for PCO2 where there was not really a dangerous increase of PCO2 in about hundred cases.

145
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:41,670
你知道这样做了7075例IP
You know so 7075 cases were done for IP and 25 cases were done for intervention cardiology and to intervention radiology.

146
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,899
这么安全很容易
So very safe very easy.

147
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:48,929
为什么是谢谢你
Yes thank you.
